# Tensorflow DIY

A [Docker](http://docker.com) file to build images for AMD & ARM devices with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs.

> Be aware! You should read carefully the usage documentation of every tool!

## Details

You will be able to choose the Tensorflow versi√≥n by choosing version tags:
- 1.14.0 (latest)
- 1.13.1
- 1.12.0
- ...

This is a [Multi-Arch](https://blog.docker.com/2017/11/multi-arch-all-the-things/) image, so you don't have to specify the target architecture because it will provide the suitable one (ARMV7/x86_64).

Despite Tensorflow is full functional in this image there are a lot of complementary tools missing, so I use it as base image for more complex images with some of this complementary tools.

This image is the base image for a set of images [Tensorflow Data Science Docker Stack](https://gist.github.com/elswork/863053972ffb86f036c0bf4fb6c7e691)
